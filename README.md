# Analysis of dark short gamma-ray bursts

**Advisor: Alexander van der Horst ([@ajvanderhorst](https://github.com/ajvanderhorst))**

This repository represents a continuation of research by David Fitzpatrick for his [bachelor's thesis (2020)](https://github.com/cgobat/dark-GRBs/blob/master/Fitzpatrick%20thesis%202020.pdf). The project aims to expand his work and incorporate more recently collected data.
