# Analysis of dark short gamma-ray bursts

**Advisor: Alexander van der Horst ([@ajvanderhorst](https://github.com/ajvanderhorst))**

This repository represents a continuation of the research done by David Fitzpatrick for his [bachelor's thesis (2020)](https://github.com/cgobat/dark-GRBs/blob/master/Fitzpatrick%20thesis%202020.pdf). The project aims to expand his work and incorporate more recently collected data.

### Overview and dependencies

- Install necessary python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt` from within this repository folder.

- [`main.py`](https://github.com/cgobat/dark-GRBs/blob/master/Calculation%20Code/main.py) and [`main.cpp`](https://github.com/cgobat/dark-GRBs/blob/master/Calculation%20Code/main.cpp) (already compiled at [`Automating the Calculation of Beta_OX.exe`](https://github.com/cgobat/dark-GRBs/blob/master/Calculation%20Code/Automating%20the%20Calculation%20of%20Beta_OX.exe), or remake it yourself) both load files from [`./Required Files/Files for Loading/`](https://github.com/cgobat/dark-GRBs/tree/master/Required%20Files/Files%20for%20Loading)

- [`Graphing_Beta_OX.py`](https://github.com/cgobat/dark-GRBs/blob/master/Graphing%20Code/Graphing_Beta_OX.py) loads the files generated by one of [the two aforementioned scripts](https://github.com/cgobat/dark-GRBs/tree/master/Calculation%20Code) from [`./Required Files/Generated Files (C++)/`](https://github.com/cgobat/dark-GRBs/tree/master/Required%20Files/Generated%20Files%20(C%2B%2B))
